Description
-----------
Allows you to draw by tracking a colored light(ex. a laser pointer) through your webcam. A GUI is available to switch brush colors, size, clear the screen, and save your masterpieces. You can also switch colors, brush size, clear screen, save the image, or close the window by using voice commands. The app will respond to notify you that your commands have been accepted.  

Dependencies
------------
Airboard requires PyAudio, Numpy, PyQt, OpenCV, SpeechRecognition, and PyGame to be installed into your environment. 
***For Windows**
We recommend installing PyAudio through Anaconda or Miniconda.
